# Two Weeks In

I started a one-year hiatus from work. Two weeks have passed. What have I
done with my time?

## My Work, After Work

- [Biking](#biking)
- [Garage Shelves](#garage-shelves)
- [Golf](#golf)
- [Grilling](#grilling)
- [Quickbooks](#quickbooks)

## Biking

I picked up a [Koa Rev+ 2 electric bike](https://tinyurl.com/yhydchxn) a few
weeks ago at the Sparks [Scheels](https://www.scheels.com/). Rather than
starting my day preparing for scrum, I head out to explore Reno by bike. One
thing though: flat tires. First, my front tire went flat. Then, both ended
up punctured. Now, I have [Tannus liners](https://tinyurl.com/5cn89afa).

I also installed a bike rack onto my Rivian, but I returned it a few days
later. Why?

* It blocked the back up camera.
* It covered my license plate.
* I had to lower it in order to open my rear hatch.
* The securing mechanism contacted the bike fenders.

At the end of the day, I probably would not have used it all that much. A
better way to go: purchase a second battery, in order to make it home if
I end up too far from home.

Biking has helped me learn Reno streets better than driving. Plus, I get to
ride along the Truckee River, across parks and through neighborhoods. Only a
few rides in and I have stopped using my navigation system for everything
above South Reno.

## Garage Shelves

My garage now looks more organized than my JIRA issues. I suppose that could
represent something positive or negative, so let me try again. My organized
my garage better than the result from `sorted()`.

With [Rubbermaid FastTrack](https://www.rubbermaid.com/fasttrackgarage.html),
I put up adjustable shelves, hooks and baskets. Now, I have a place for
everything and every thing in its place.

## Golf

Another Scheels visit and I walked out with some Callaway Stata clubs. I felt
like Al Czervik, "Gimme half a dozen of those and set me up with the whole
schmeer. You know, clubs, bags, shoes, gloves, shirt, pants. Hey, orange
balls! Gimme a box of those. Gimme two of those -- six of those" Though, I
could not find a box of naked lady tees. I did spot the worst-looking hat
I ever saw. I wonder if it comes with a free bowl of soup.

The neighborhood has a par-3 nine-hole course. I get in a good walk. And,
this week I made par on one hole. After hitting the ball six feet or so from
the hole, it still took me two putts to sink it. Even if I never get good at
golf, the exercise should do me good.

## Grilling

Anjali and I have entertained friends, plus we have joined neighbors to
expand our monkeysphere. I have used this as an excuse to fire up the grill
several times. Plates of ribeyes and ribs have fed people, but I have also
ventured out a bit. Last week, I made "fully-loaded baked potato" salad.
Basically, this amounts to potato chunks with sour cream (and crema), cheese
and bacon stirred in. I add a hint of mustard, some vinegar and a bit of
Worcestershire sauce. Sprinkle in salt, garlic powder and pepper, then top it
all off with some cayenne powder.

I also made [shotgun shells](https://youtu.be/yMfWDafuFGo). Talk about a hit!
These things have me invited to every future neighborhood get-together. For
my version, I mixed hamburger with chorizo, added a bunch of sharp cheddar
cheese and seasonings, then a dash of Worcestershire sauce. Just before
pulling them from the grill, I brushed on some sauce. I take a good amount of
[Everett and Jones MED BBQ sauce](https://www.super-que.com/), add cheap
yellow mustard, some vinegar and seasonings, to make a great sauce.

Choped each in half and plated them up pretty for serving.

## Quickbooks

I track all rental property and self-employment expenses in Google Sheets,
which helps at tax time. Over the past couple of weeks, I have decided to
finally learn Quickbooks. I still have much to learn, but with some effort
I should have enough online for a bookkeeper or CPA to review business
finances.
