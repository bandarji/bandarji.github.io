# About Sean

In no particular order:

- **Linux Geek:** A UNIX user since 1987, I started using Linux professionally
in 1994
- **Network Whisperer:** Worked many protocols from all layers of the OSI
model
- **Code Writer:** Polyamorous with Go, Python and Rust
- **Coffee Drinker:** Hard to start a day without a cup of joe
- **World Traveler:** Singing my own "I've been everywhere, man" song
- **War Criminal:** I have a long story to tell about buying a Hawaiian house
- **Monkey King:** Some refer to me as Bandarji, others _Bandaron ka Badshah_

Since growing up in Texas, I have lived in California, Karnataka and Hawaii.
At the end of 2024, I moved to Reno, Nevada, with my super-realtor wife,
Anjali, and our dog, Smokey.
