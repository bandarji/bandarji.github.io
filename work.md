# Work Experience

My professional journey spans over three decades. The initial decade granted
me opportunities to develop and hone systems, networking and coding skills.
In those early years, I assembled Internet Service Providers, launched Linux
ports of UNIX software and implemented business IP networking solutions.

In 2000, I established Aloe Software Group, a company that provided online
student and financial management for Texas public schools. That same year,
I joined First Victoria National Bank, to overhaul their network in
preparation for expansion and interoperability, as their grew through
acquisition.

I left Texas in 2005, joining San Francisco Bay Area startup MobiTV. As the
Systems and Networking Engineering Manager, I organized efforts to maintain
availability during times of rapid customer and offering expansions.

DreamWorks Animation offered me a position in 2007, so I moved to Los
Angeles, to join the AnimTech group as a Senior Network Engineer. In 2008,
I relocated to Bengaluru, India, where I hired and trained support staff at
a new animation studio, as an Engineering Manager. After returning stateside,
DreamWorks promoted me to Principal Engineer and had me focus on future
rendering techologies. In 2015, I managed the team responsible for
containerizing film animation software, for a live 3D rendering SaaS. That
startup shuttered in 2017, when Universal purchased DreamWorks.

I continued my career progression at [Box](https://box.com/) as a Staff Site
Reliability Engineer on the Edge Performance team. There, I developed a
distributed firewall solution and overhauled service proxy implementations.

In 2018, Twitter hired me to manage storage engineering teams. After a
couple of years, I transitioned to an individual contributor role. As a Staff
Site Reliability Engineer, I participated in several high-impact storage
projects. Due to the turmoil and uncertainty Twitter presented employees
after Musk bought the company, I left in 2023.

That same year, I joined Upstart as the Principal Site Reliability Engineer.
There, I revitalized the Postmortem Bar Raisers program and revamped incident
management processes and procedures. I automated metrics collection and
representation for leadership status reports.

In 2025, I stepped away from work, taking a one-year hiatus to travel the
world.
